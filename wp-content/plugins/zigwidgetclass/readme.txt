Requires at least: 3.6
Tested up to: 3.8
Stable tag: 0.6.1

Lets you add a custom CSS class to each widget instance.

== Description ==

ZigWidgetClass adds a free text field to each widget control form on your widget admin page. Enter a CSS class name in the box and it will be added to the classes that WordPress applies to that widget instance. 

It has been tested and verified to work with the Widget Logic plugin, the Widget Context plugin and the WP Page Widgets plugin. If you have problems getting it to work with one of those plugins, make sure you are using the latest version(s).

It only works with widgets that were created by extending the built-in multi-widget class. If it appears not to work on a certain widget, that widget is probably not a multi-widget. 

Also, if you have trouble getting it to work with the WP Page Widgets plugin, you should create and save each page widget first, before adding the CSS class, then save again.

Requires WordPress 3.6+ and PHP 5.2.4+.
