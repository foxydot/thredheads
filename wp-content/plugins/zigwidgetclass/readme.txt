Tested up to: 3.5.2
Stable tag: 0.5

Lets you add a custom class to each widget instance.

== Description ==

ZigWidgetClass adds a free text field to each widget control form on your widget admin page. Enter a class name in the box and it will be added to the classes that WordPress applies to that widget instance. 

It has been tested and verified to work with both the Widget Logic plugin and the Widget Context plugin. If you have problems getting it to work with one of those plugins, make sure you are using the latest version of that plugin.

IMPORTANT: It only works with widgets created by extending the built-in multi-widget class! If it appears not to work on a certain widget, that widget is probably not a multi-widget.

Requires WordPress 3.5+ and PHP 5.2.4+.
