Extensively road tested using the GoDaddy [P3 Plugin Performance Profiler](http://wordpress.org/plugins/p3-profiler/). We recommend you get and install this mighty plugin. You will soon get rid of any badly coded plugin that is slowing your site load speed. Cumulative testing of the Dynamic Gallery shows:

= Plugin Security =

At a3rev we take plugin security very seriously. This plugins code is hardened with all inputs sanitized and outputs escaped in accordance with the WordPress codex. We welcome security mined developers reviewing the code.

= Trusted WordPress / WP e-Commerce Plugin Developers =

We are one of only 12 [WP e-Commerce recommended developers](http://getshopped.org/consultant/) world wide. This plugins source code strictly adheres to the WordPress coding standards:

* Source code written using consistent spacing, indenting, for ease of understanding and editing.
* Namespacing with registered Class names and commenting. 
* Where applicable all JavaScript uses the WordPress jQuery Lib
* Functions use the WordPress API. 
* Scripts enqueued and only called when and where needed (Key to optimizing plugin resource use and hence average load time)
* Internationalization. Plugin includes language folder and coded ready for localization using poeditor (WordPress Codex)
* Cleans Up After Itself. The plugin has an option which when set completely removes any and all code and tables it has created in your WordPress site.       

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface =
Like WordPress we believe that a3rev plugin users should be able to configure and tweak our plugins settings while on the go, right from their mobile or tablet. This plugins features an app style admin interface with Switches, Sliders and a smart interface that hides associated settings when a feature is not turned ON.

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.8.0 admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.5.0
* App style admin interface.
* Admin app interface is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

= Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =
All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version. Pro Version features and settings are easy to spot on the admin dashboard as they are inside of a Yellow border. The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels so they can be used BUT the settings do not save when changes are saved and hence are not applied to the front end. Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member. Upgrading to a Pro Version Licence gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and hence Lifetime priority support as part of the License.


= Pro Version Additional Functionality =

This plugin features a Pro version upgrade that adds extra functionality. You will see all of the available upgrade features inside of the Yellow border areas on the Free Lite Version admin panel. Some of those advanced features include:

* Front end Users see Product variation images in gallery as they select options.

* Exclude Variation images from main gallery - only show when variation is selected.
* When variations are created they auto show on the Gallery Image Manager.
* Upload images using the WordPress media uploader or Dynamic Gallery image uploader and assign images to variations or variation sets. 
* Makes handling variation images very quick and easy. 

= Responsive - All Browsers and Mobiles =

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev developers on the plugins support forum.

* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show in the Gallery Container instead of the current image because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin  and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Dynamic Gallery will automatically detect that and works as it should.
