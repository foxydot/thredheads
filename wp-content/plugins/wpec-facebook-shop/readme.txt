This plugin will import your WP-Ecommerce shop to Facebook in a couple of minutes, with no development or design skills required.

== Description ==

[StoreYa's](http://www.StoreYa.com) plugin automatically imports your WP-Commerce web stores onto your Facebook fan page having it fully customized to fit both the Facebook arena and the original brand's look & feel.

(If you are using WooCommerce Shopping Cart, please use [this plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-shop-by-storeyacom/) of StoreYa).

StoreYa can also automatically import all of your social networks activities from Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube onto Facebook.

AND - to top all that StoreYa will provide you with the following social marketing tools that will boost your sales:

- **Group Deal** - a marketing tool enabling you to have your fans attracting their friends to join a specific deal that will only take place if certain amount of users, defined by you, joins it. [Watch this short video](http://vimeo.com/48532142) to see how the Group Deal gained over 1,000 sales and 4,000 new fans in 24 hours to our Scandinavian fashion brand merchant, OnePiece.

**Q: How do I open a Facebook fan page?**

and fill out your company or product info. This one is really self explanatory - even Mark (Zuckerberg) didn't have much to say about it - see here.


**Q: Can I log in using my fan page and not my Facebook personal profile?**

A: Logging into StoreYa is done by connecting with Facebook using your personal profile (due to Facebook's limitations),
BUT - at the end of our very short import process, you will be provided with a link enabling you to connect your new Facebook store to a Facebook fan page of your choice (a fan page that you are its admin, of course). Your personal profile will serve you to log into your StoreYa back-office. There will be no connection between your store and your personal profile at Facebook's end.
