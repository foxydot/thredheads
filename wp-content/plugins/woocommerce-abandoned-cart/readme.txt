This easy-to-use plugin gives store owners the ability to recover sales that are lost to abandoned shopping carts by logged-in customers. 

== Description ==

Abandoned Cart plugin works in the background, sending email notifications to your customers, reminding them about their abandoned orders.

The Abandoned Cart plugin allows you to recover orders that were just a step away from closing. It enables you to create automatic & well-timed email reminders to be sent to your customers who have added your products to their cart, but did not complete the order. As a result, with this plugin you will start recovering at least 30% or more of your lost sales. Why let this 30% revenue go unclaimed?

Abandoned Cart plugin enables Customers to:
<ol>
<li>Recover their abandoned carts in a single click</li>
